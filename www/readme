Steps to run server:
 - docker-compose up
 - Inside webserver (docker exec -ti mend-webserver /bin/bash) run:
 - composer install
 - composer update
 - vendor/bin/phinx migrate
 - frontend tested on Chrome
To run the tests simply run "vendor/bin/phpunit" inside the www directory
This is a list of files that I modified/created:
  Backend:
   - /app/Http/Cotrollers/Api/TaskController.php
   - /app/Http/Resources/Task.php
   - /app/Task.php
   - /routes/api.php
   - /tests/Feature/Http/Controllers/Api/TaskControllerTest.php
   - swagger.yaml
  Frontend:
   	- assets/css/main.css
   	- assets/js/main.js
   	- public/tasks.html


Note: I added two links to the index file (localhost/) Tasks Test Site and Task API endpoints Docs the first one is the frontend of my test, and the second is an autogenerated from the API definition.

Thanks for reading.
